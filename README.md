# The-Gleaming-Geode
This website project is made to demonstrate my love of rocks since I was given creative freedom.
During this I used a combination of CSS and bootstrap to write my code, I did this so I could learn how this stuff works better. The downside is that some more complex features are not present.
During this, I found out how gradients work in CSS, but I didn’t write that code. Most of the code I wrote was either stuff I already knew or I edited and repurposed other code from bootstrap. Though something I was able to figure out was how to make custom buttons make images static on a page.
The mobile side of it isn’t fully working, but it mostly is. I had a hard time figuring it out.
My goal wasn’t to make an amazing and fully working website, but to show what I have learned and have some fun along the way, so some listings or things I put aren’t what you would call professional since this is a project. That's my own way of making this project my own I suppose.
I dont know how to put screenshots in this so heres a link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slTp4cgViPpvrDBo4wNYTvgh61l8W900IZAEV3EhN0g/edit?usp=sharing
